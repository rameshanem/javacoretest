String:
======
String is a sequance of charaters or gorup of word which we can include  double qotes from the both the ends.

By using String class , we can create an object in two ways:

1) Uisng  String leterals
2) Uisng new keyword

==> A string is an immutable class that means once an object is created it wont be chnage or modify.? for that yu can check using hashcode method
Which is avalable Object class

==> when u crate an object using literally it will be stroring into a specila kind of memeory called "SCP"
==> When vcreate an object using new keyword it will stroe inot narmal heap memoey.
with this new operator always creates new String object only where as , when u ceate using litteralyy, it will check first whether that object is there 
with the contet in SCP Pool . if it is there it will pointing to same refernce.

==>If you want check wther the conte=t is same or not you can alsways use equals method
==>If you want check objects are same are not go with == operator.

Finally By using String class you can perform different operations like as append, get the index of any charater, lentgh , convert into upper and lower 
like that have different methods avalable in String class.


==>to find out whetehr it is immutable or not check the api class and verify whther the calss is final or not and sjhould not have setter methods
